# bus-monitoring-system
This project is a Flask-based web application that logs the entry and exit times of buses using RFID tags and stores the data in an Excel file (buslog22.xlsx). The system reads data from a serial-connected RFID reader (e.g., Arduino), automatically toggles the bus status (Entered/Exited), and provides a user interface for administration
