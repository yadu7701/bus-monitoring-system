#🚌 Bus Entry-Exit Logging System (RFID + Flask)
This project is a Flask-based web application that logs the entry and exit times of buses using RFID tags and stores the data in an Excel file (buslog22.xlsx). The system reads data from a serial-connected RFID reader (e.g., Arduino), automatically toggles the bus status (Entered/Exited), and provides a user interface for administration.

#🔧 Features
📟 Real-time data logging via serial port (COM3).

🕒 Timestamped log entries of bus movement (entry/exit).

🧾 Excel file generation for all activity (buslog22.xlsx).

🌐 Flask-based UI to view and manage RFID tags.

📥 Downloadable logs through /download.

➕ Add new RFID UIDs to the system.

🔁 Status toggling logic based on last recorded action.

Connect RFID Reader
Ensure your RFID reader (via Arduino or similar) is connected to COM3. Update COM3 in the script if needed.
🔌 Endpoints
Endpoint Description

/ Admin panel showing UID-bus mappings
/download Download the Excel log file
/add-uid POST route to add a new UID + name
/get-data Returns JSON of current bus events
🧠 Logic Overview
Serial Reader Thread: Reads RFID tag from Arduino via COM3.

Toggle System: First scan = Entered, next = Exited (and so on).

Log Storage: Every event is saved with timestamp and status.

Web Interface: Admin can add UID-bus mappings and download logs.

#📌 Note
Ensure your Arduino is programmed to send messages like: "Access granted for: Bus42"

The status alternates based on the last recorded action for a bus.
